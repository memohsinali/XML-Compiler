# XML-Compiler
Design a C++ program that uses the stack class for matching tags and quotes in XML extensive Markup
Language. Your program will get an XML code in an input file, and it should figure out if tags and quotes
are properly matched or not using stack. In case the tags are not matched, then your program should
report i) the error, ii) print the mismatched tag and iii) print the line number at which the starting tag
occurred. And then continue parsing the input XML file till the XML file ends.

What is XML? XML is a markup language somewhat like HTML. It was designed to store and transport data. XML is just
information wrapped in user-defined tags which is both human- and machine-readable. The XML language has no
predefined tags like HTML. The tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document. For details, see
https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<note>
<to>Tove</to>
<from>Jani</from>
<heading>Reminder</heading>
<message>Don't forget me this weekend!</message>
</note>
In above example
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
This is XML prolog (header). It starts with <? and ends with ?>. The header should come in the start of
the document.

<note>, <from>, <heading> and <message> are user defined tags and each must have a corresponding ending tag.
Your program should handle the following features of XML:
1. xml prolog (xml header)
2. xml tags (xml elements). The xml tags are case-sensitive.
3. xml attribute
4. xml comments, start with <!-- and ends with -->


Consider another example
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<bookstore>
<book category="cooking">
<title lang="en">Everyday Italian</title>
<author>Giada De Laurentiis</author>
<year>2005</year>
<price>30.00</price>
</book>
<book category="children">
<title lang="en">Harry Potter</title>
<author>J K. Rowling</author>
<year>2005</year>
<price>29.99</price>
</book>
</bookstore>
In the example above:
<title>, <author>, <year>, and <price> have text content because they contain text (like 2005).
<bookstore> and <book> have element contents, because they contain elements.
<book> has an attribute (category="children").
Note that Attribute values must always be quoted. Either single or double quotes can
be used.
Your program should keep track that the attributes have opening and closing quotes.
Your code will have a template-based Node class Stack class. Implement stack using singly linked list.
template<class T>
class Stack {
private:
class Node {
T data;
Node<T> * next;
Node<T> * top;
};
public:
Stack() ;
~Stack();
bool IsEmpty();
bool push(const T & val);
bool pop(T & val);
}; bool top(T & val);
Create XMLData class
Think about its attributes carefully

void main(){
Stack<XMLData> S1;


Note: (Not Mandatory , itâ€™s your choice)
You can also made simple functions in XMLData class and call them in main() as:

XMLData d1;
d1.checkAttribute();
BUT for that case your XML class must inherit your Stack class.
